<!-- Features -->
## Features üîé
### Client-Side: -
- Utilizing Parsing Techniques to Retrieve Location and Miscellaneous Data
  - Extracting Basic Info, Skills, and Keywords

- New: Paste a Job Description (JD) and see a JD-match score with top missing keywords
- New: DOCX upload support (PDF and DOCX are both supported)
- New: Refreshed UI/theme for better readability

Employing logical programs to provide recommendations on:
- Additional skills
- Predicted job role
- Relevant courses and certificates
- Resume tips and ideas
- Overall Score
- Access to Interview & Resume tip videos

### Data & Storage:
- Local persistence via SQLite (no external DB needed by default)
- Visitor counter with DB tracking and session-based fallback

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
1) Upload & Pre-processing
- User uploads a resume as PDF or DOCX. PDFs are previewed inline; DOCX is parsed directly.
- Text is extracted via pdfminer.six (PDF) or docx2txt (DOCX).
- pyresparser + spaCy (en_core_web_sm) + NLTK tokenize and extract: name, email, phone, degree, skills, and page count.

2) Skill & Field Inference
- Extracted skills are matched against curated keyword lists to infer a likely field (e.g., Data Science, Web, Android, iOS, UI/UX).
- Based on the inferred field, the app recommends additional skills and relevant courses (from `App/Courses.py`).

3) Resume Heuristics Scoring
- A ruleset checks for presence of common sections: Objective/Summary, Education, Experience/Internships, Skills, Hobbies/Interests, Achievements, Certifications, Projects.
- A progress bar visualizes the computed score.

4) JD Match Scoring (Optional)
- User pastes a Job Description (JD). The app tokenizes JD text, removes stopwords, and compares against resume tokens + extracted skills.
- It outputs a JD-match percentage and a list of top missing keywords to add to the resume.

5) Results & Extras
- Displays extracted basics, score, recommendations, and two helpful videos (resume tips and interview tips).
- Data can be stored to the local SQLite DB for admin analytics (optional).

## System Architecture üß≠
- UI: Streamlit app (`App/App.py`)
- Parsing Layer:
  - PDF: pdfminer.six
  - DOCX: docx2txt
  - NLP: spaCy (en_core_web_sm), NLTK (stopwords)
  - pyresparser for entity/skill extraction (uses spaCy internally)
- Heuristics & Recommendations: Python rule-based logic + keyword lists
- Storage: SQLite (`resume_reviewer.db`) created at runtime (no external setup)
- Visualization: Plotly for charts (admin/feedback analytics)

## Technologies Used üß∞
- Streamlit, Python 3.10+
- spaCy, NLTK, pyresparser
- pdfminer.six, docx2txt
- pandas, plotly, streamlit-tags
- SQLite (default) or MySQL (optional, if you re-enable connector)

## Security & Privacy üîí
- PII (name, email, phone) may be parsed for display and optional storage.
- By default, data is stored locally in SQLite; for production, use a managed DB and restrict access.
- Avoid uploading confidential documents to public deployments.
- No third-party API calls are required for core functionality.

## Deployment Options üöÄ
- Streamlit Community Cloud: simplest. Connect GitHub repo and deploy.
- Render/Railway/Fly.io: containerize (Docker) if you need more control or background workers.
- Vercel (not recommended for Streamlit directly): use only if you split into a FastAPI backend + Next.js frontend.

## Limitations & Future Enhancements üß™
- OCR for image-based/scanned PDFs not enabled (could add Tesseract + pytesseract).
- JD match uses keyword overlap; a semantic matcher (e.g., embeddings) could improve quality.
- Multilingual resumes are not deeply supported; add locale detection and language-specific models for best results.

### Admin-Side: -
- Aggregating all applicant data in a tabular format
- Downloading user data in CSV format
- Viewing all saved uploaded PDFs in the Uploaded Resume folder
- Collecting user feedback and ratings
  
  Generating Pie Charts for: -
- Ratings
- Predicted fields/roles
- Experience levels
- Resume scores
- User counts
- City, State, and Country breakdown

### Feedback System: -
- Easy-to-fill forms
- Rating scale from 1 to 5
- Displaying an overall ratings pie chart
- Providing a history of past user comments 

## Requirements üîê
### Ensure a Smooth Process by Installing the Following:
1) Python 3.10+ (3.11‚Äì3.13 recommended): [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Visual Studio Code **(Preferred Code Editor)**: [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

## Setup & Installation üëÄ

To run this project, perform the following tasks üò®

Download the code file manually or via git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1e9abhi1e10/AI-Based-Resume-Reviewer.git
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it **(recommended)**

Open your terminal and change your project directory to ```AI-Based-Resume-Reviewer``` and run the following: 
```bash
python -m venv venv
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies (minimal set to run the app):
```bash
cd App
pip install streamlit pandas plotly streamlit-tags docx2txt nltk pyresparser pdfminer.six geopy geocoder

# Models/data downloads
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run App.py
```

Notes:
- The app defaults to SQLite (creates a local file automatically). No DB setup needed.
- If you want to use MySQL instead, restore the original connector in `App/App.py` and ensure credentials/DB exist.

## Usage
- After the setup it will do stuff's automatically
- You just need to upload a resume and see it's magic
- Try first with my resume uploaded in ``Uploaded_Resumes`` folder
- Admin userid is ``admin`` and password is ``admin@resume-Reviewer``

### New UI/Feature Tips
- Paste a JD in the new textarea to see the JD match score and missing keywords.
- Upload DOCX or PDF; PDFs show inline preview, DOCX is analyzed without preview.
- The sidebar theme is dark with improved contrast for selections.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see spaCy or NLTK errors, re-run:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
```
- If `pyresparser` throws model/config warnings, they are safe; we load the standard spaCy model by default.
